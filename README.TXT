This Python program is designed to calculate the percentage of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black (CMYK) colors in an image. It is useful for estimating ink usage when printing an image.

Main Features:
Image File Selection:
Uses a file dialog to select an image file in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
RGB to CMYK Conversion:
Converts each pixel in the image from RGB to CMYK.
Considers white color as 0% for all CMYK components.
CMYK Percentage Calculation:
Calculates the percentage of each color component (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) in the image.
Image Display:
Displays the selected image in the program window, resized to fit within 600 x 400 pixels.
Progress Bar:
Shows the progress of the color percentage calculation.
Bar Chart:
Displays the CMYK color percentages in a bar chart for easy visualization.
How to Use:
Run the program.
Click the "Open Image File" button to select the image for color percentage calculation.
The program will display the image, show the calculation progress, and present the CMYK color percentages in a bar chart.
This program helps users understand how much ink will be used to print a particular image, allowing for more efficient ink usage planning.
